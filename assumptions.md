# Assumptions for Dungeon Mania

# Assumptions for Collectable Entities:

- Player can collect an unlimited number of entities (with the exception of key).
- (Maybe) Place a limit on the number of swords/armour the player can hold (Avoids unrealistic combat).
- TheOneRing is used immediately after the player dies (the player is not given a choice to use it or not).

# Assumptions for Buildable Entities:

- (Maybe) Player can only hold 1 bow and 1 shield at a time. Creating another bow/shield discards the currently existing bow/shield. (Prevents unrealistic combat)
- Shield/bow is used automatically in combat. Player is not given an option to use it or not.
